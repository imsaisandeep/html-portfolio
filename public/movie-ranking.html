<h3>Jersey</h3>
<p>its a wonderful movie based on an cricketer who is suffering from a disease called arithmea.nani acted really well in the movie.</p>
<h3>jaya lava kusa</h3>
<P>its a wonderful movie which shows the bond between the brothers. the directer and hero pulled off very easily. some scenes makes us cry also especially the play played by the 3 brothers and the story and dialogues that are linked to the play are really nice. and how they managed to attach the threads is superb.</P>
